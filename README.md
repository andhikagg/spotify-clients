# Spotify Clients

A lightweight, fast, and completely **dependency-free** JavaScript library to interact with the Spotify Web API and download tracks.

Features a native `fetch` instance that mimics Axios behavior, and supports both CommonJS (CJS) & ECMAScript Modules (ESM) environments out of the box!

## 📦 Setup

Place this module in your project. No `npm install` of third-party dependencies required!

## 🚀 Usage

### CommonJS (CJS)
```javascript
const sp = require('spotify-clients');

async function test() {
    // Search 
    const res = await sp.search("blue");
    console.log(res);
}

test();
```

### ES Modules (ESM)
```javascript
import sp, { search, download } from 'spotify-clients';

// Using Default Export
const res = await sp.search("blue");
console.log(res);

// Using Named Exports
const trackData = await download('https://open.spotify.com/track/4PTG3Z6ehGkBFwjybzWkR8');
console.log(trackData);
```
